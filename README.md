# SKALE Website

SKALE (Student Knowledge and Applied Learning in Engineering) is a student-led initiative at California State University San Marcos (CSUSM) that empowers engineering students to build real-world skills through hands-on projects and community collaboration. Originally focused on the University Rover Challenge, the team strategically pivoted to develop an autonomous navigation golf cart, a project more aligned with student interests in AI, electronics, and distributed systems.

Whether you're a student, donor, or curious supporter, this site provides updates, insights, and opportunities to get involved in growing CSUSMâ€™s engineering community.
